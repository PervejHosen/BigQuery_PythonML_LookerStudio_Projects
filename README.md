# Google Cloud Project

## Tools: BigQuery, Notebook(Python), LookerStudio

# Game Plun:
  1. Build Database in BigQuery
  2. Connect to database with Python (Colab to Bigquery)
  3. Build a Churn Model (PyCaret)
  4. Export data to BigQuery
  5. Build Dashboard in LookerStudio

# Request from StakeHolders(Pilot Program)
## Problem Statement :
  * We are having issues with keeping employees, so we would like a data anlayst to help to proactively find employees that are at risk.
## Approch :
  * Select pilot program with new employees.
  * Build an Auto ML model trained on previous data that can predict a new employees will leave.
## Deliverable: 
  * Report/Dashboard
## Analysis Questions:
  1. What is causing Employees to leave?
  2. Who is Predicted to leave?
     - (Highest probability to leave)
  3. Are employees satisfied?
  4. What department has the  most Churn?
## Project Questions:
  1. What does success look like?
     - (Highly accurate prediction model)
  2. What does failure look like?
     - (Inaccurate model)
  3. What trends are important?
     - (Features that are causing Churn)
  4. What actions affects the trend?
     - (Recommendations)
